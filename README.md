# apple-game

Fun project done in 8 hours. It is a training tool / game for the fruit box apple game: https://en.gamesaien.com/game/fruit_box/.
It contains tons of different modes, including Auto, which is an heuristic approach to solve a table of apples.

To play this game you need to download it from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ab4lP2J1KgszubaacpLdNMleQ7f-PIbc/view?usp=sharing

Sorry for the messy implementation, it was a challenge to finish the game as soon as possible.

Have fun!
